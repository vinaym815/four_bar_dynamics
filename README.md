This is the matlab code and presentation of the dynamics of four bar mechanism  that I worked on during an assignment of Multibody Dyanimcs course. The code works for  Grashof's  Crank Crank and Crank Rocker mechanism. The code
first computes the torques required for a cycloidal motion of the input link and then feeds the torque back into the system. I'm also attaching the cinderella and geogebra files used for validating the inverse kinematics and the simMechanics file used for validating the matlab code.
